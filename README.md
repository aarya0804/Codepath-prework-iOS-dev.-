## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My 3-5 favorite applications:
- DoorDash: 
    1. cuisine picking at the top of the app with a small icon for each of them to give, 
    2. shows open/close hours of each store, and
    3. reviews from users about every store
    
- Spotify: 
    1. personalized playlist based on your recent listening,
    2. add or download other peoples playlist in your library
    3. different sections for different type of audio media like music, audiobooks, podcasts
- Instagram:
    1. save/bookmark posts you like
    2. send yourself posts, reels that u find helpful
    3. add close friends stories
- Youtube:
    1. categorization of different visual media like podcasts, movies, shorts, vidoes based on your interests
    2. add videos in queue to watch one after other
- Calm:
    1. some meaningful message that pops up right when you open the application
    2. provides genuine, sometimes helpful messages in their notifications that make u pause and actually read them instead of just sliding it away like any other app notification
    3. soundscape feature where you can play any background sound even when your phone is off, for hours. 

    
- An application I'd like to build would be a travel guide application called "Vista" with some AI-powered features. Users can get an AI-generated itinerary for different locations by giving their preferences to it. They can also find local gems or locals favorite spots using the app and maybe even get discount coupons to any of the stores at their location by exploring as many as local spots as they can, almost sort of a mini-game. They could also take a picture of any sign/board in a foreign language and translate it into the language they understand, again powered by AI. All of this also comes with the basic maps feature for users to simply search for any place they'd like and bookmark the ones they'd like to explore later. Lastly, it would also include a feature where users could upload the pictures they take during their trip and the app could give them an edited compilation of with music in bg of their trip, something the users could look back at later as a memory. They'd also have the option to edit it themselves if they'd like. 

    Here's a quick list of all the features the app would have:
    - AI-powered itinerary generator
    - Minigame to get discounts/coupons + explore locals' favorite spots
    - AI-powered language translator
    - Maps to search locations 
    - Bookmark interested location(s) 
    - Create a video of their trip as a memorable event.
    
    The app still has quite a lot of room for enhancement(s) in current features plus any additions of new ones in the future. There isn't any feature where they could book their trip as of now since that would require further integration with other party apps to give the users the best prices possible, which as of now is something that can be done in the foreseeable future. 
     The ultimate goal of this app would be to give personalized travel experience to its users and make this app a once stop destination for them that they could use before, during and after their trip.
